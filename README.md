> ## What is a chat API?

A chat API is an application programming interface that **provides access to cloud-based infrastructure** with the features to build real-time chat experiences that scale. Chat APIs are usually offered as a service, and they can be easily embedded in an application with the use of a chat SDK (Software Development Kit).

In contrast to a  [messaging API](https://www.pubnub.com/learn/glossary/what-is-a-messaging-api/), which focuses on SMS and MMS messaging, a chat API focuses entirely on providing features built on web-based instant messaging, such as HTTPS and other protocols.

Often, chat APIs package messaging information in an easy-to-understand data format, like JSON payloads. This lets them work between platforms, and allows developers to easily format chat information for end-users.

Additionally, the best chat APIs are just one part of a larger real-time communication platform. This means that the service you initially use for chat will facilitate expansion to new features, like push notifications, video calling, and chatbots.

You can use a chat API in almost any context. Whether you’re building an app or a web-based experience, you can use a chat API to build engaging, responsive chat for many use cases.You can use a chat API in almost any context.
